I'm married to a wonderful woman who teaches English at a local high school, and I have three cats (Avery, Polly, and Daisy) and a dog (Lilly). In 2022, we welcomed a baby boy who has been an incredible addition to our lives. When I'm not writing code, I enjoy reading, running, playing some video games, listening to music, and watching TV.
