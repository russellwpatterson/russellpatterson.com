I’m really, really busy right now.

I just had two tests this past week, and I got a 94% (the highest grade in the class) on my Random Signal Analysis exam and an 80% on my Combinatorics and Graph Theory test. I’m really satisfied with my RSA score, not so much my CGT score.

I’m working on various research-related things right now which promise to absolutely destroy any chances at a life. It looks as though I’m going to be spending most of my week in the lab instead of going home at normal hours.

This weekend I’m heading to Kentucky for my goddaughter’s birthday party and then the following weekend I guess I’m going to Columbus since Kevin is coming up from Virginia Tech. My car hates me right now. Four out of the last seven weekends I’ve driven more than 250 miles to go see people.
