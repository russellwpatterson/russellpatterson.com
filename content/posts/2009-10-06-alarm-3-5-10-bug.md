I've received a report of a bug in Alarm 3.5.10 which causes the program to freeze when it is sounding and is switching between songs on the playlist.  If anyone is dealing with this problem, please send an email to russell (AT) russellpatterson.com immediately with a description of your computer system specifications.  Obviously I want to fix this as soon as possible.

Thanks.
