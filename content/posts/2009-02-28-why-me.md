Well, obviously since I was going to be playing a bunch of games this week, my xbox just HAD to die. It gave me the red lights, so I went out and bought a new one. I mean, I just got addicted to Assassins Creed and I had just preordered Halo Wars. What timing! I still haven’t transferred everything over yet, but I should be able to do that today. I bought the Elite so I really hope this one lasts.

Also, Sam’s Club has a known liberal bias. They don’t accept Visa.
