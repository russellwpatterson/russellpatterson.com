Today I put together an aggressive roadmap to get Alarm 4 out the door by April 2.  While the dates aren't set in stone, I will be working diligently on meeting the dates that I have planned.  Here's a summary of my release goals:

* Alpha 1: February 15, 2010 - Main design goals completed (Scheduler)
* Alpha 2: February 22, 2010 - Secondary goals completed (Startup, Wake from Sleep)
* Alpha 3: March 1, 2010 - Other goals completed (New update system, Theming, Media Search)
* Beta 1: March 8, 2010 - Bug Fixes, code cleanup
* Beta 2: March 15, 2010 - Bug Fixes, code cleanup
* RC 1: March 19, 2010 - Bug Fixes and Finalization
* RC 2: March 26, 2010 - Final Fixes and Changes
* 4.0.0: April 2, 2010

As I have done in the past, the first patch version (4.0.1) will be released about a week later with following updates about every month or so.  The alpha versions will go out only to testers.  If you would like to become a tester, please send an email to support (AT) russellpatterson.com and I will add you to my list.

EDITED ON JANUARY 31, 2010: Pushed back a couple dates due to unforeseen issues.
