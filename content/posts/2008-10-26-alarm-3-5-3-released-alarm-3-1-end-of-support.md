In Alarm 3.5.3, I have fixed about 7 bugs and added a new feature.  I also added about 10 themes.

Also, as of today, Alarm 3.1 is no longer supported to be auto-updated to 3.5.  There are way too many files to update every time I release a new version.  If you're using 3.1, you should have updated a long time ago!

As a final note, I'm pretty sure that I'm up to 2800 downloads total among all the websites that host Alarm 3.5.2.  I should get an estimate of who actually uses it based on how many people update to 3.5.3.  I'm pretty happy about all this "having users" business.
