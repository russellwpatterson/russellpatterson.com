I am pleased to be releasing Alarm 3.5.11.  This version, while originally deemed a major update, has been downgraded minor update due to an overly-complicated update process between 3.5.10 and 3.5.11.  So, the new settings system is delayed for Alarm 4.0, as originally intended.  Having the new system in earlier 3.5.11 builds though has allowed me to fix a few issues with the system.

Changes to 3.5.11 are as follows:
* **Addition**: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 Hour and Custom Quick Alarms. Thanks to Missy for the suggestion.
* **Addition**: Alarm 4 About dialog added.
* **Change**: Removed one of the first startup dialogs. (The thanks dialog)
* **Change**: Code refactoring
* **Change**: Automatically Displays Morning Reminder when Alarm goes off.
* **Change**: Some changes to the default settings.
* **Addition**: Release Notes Viewer
* **Change**: Check for Updates doesn’t run on first startup.
* **Addition**: University of Akron (Grad School) Color Scheme.
* **Change**: Adjust Volume now disabled when media isn’t selected.

This will hopefully be the last version of Alarm 3.5.  Alarm 4.0 is coming, I promise.

Also, Merry Christmas to everyone!
