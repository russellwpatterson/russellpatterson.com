Today, I released SimpleLookups v1.1, which is a small change to the library that is taking the world by storm. (Disclaimer: May not be as popular as advertised.)

This version includes a couple of small API changes, as well as a couple new methods.

New Features:
- Get a list of lookup values based on a list of ids.
- Remove a list of lookup values based on a list of ids.

Changed Features:
- The method "GetById" is now called "Get".
- The API will now return IList instead of List.
