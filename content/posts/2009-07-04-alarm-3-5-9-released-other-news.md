Today, I'm releasing Alarm 3.5.9.  This build is 99.9% the same as RC 2.

New features since 3.5.8 include:
- Volume control - control the volume of Alarm separately from the system volume.
- Focus Time - choose whether the alarm time takes the place of the current time when the alarm is set.

It is available from the update service for versions since 3.5 and will be made available for download from this site as soon as I complete this post.

In other, other news, the update service of previous Alarm versions will be removed based on the following schedule:
- Alarm 3.1.7-3.1.8 - Update support already ended.
- Alarm 3.5-3.5.7 - Update support will end on August 1, 2009.
- Alarm 3.5.8 RC 1 - Update support will end on July 15, 2009.
- Alarm 3.5.8-3.5.9 - Update support will end approximately October 1, 2009.

Anyways, that's about it for now.  Update that software everybody!
