From now on, I will be most likely wearing contacts. I’ve been trying them out for the past few weeks and so far I really enjoy having them. I’ve actually become pretty good at putting them in and taking them out, which was my main problem last time I tried them.

My xbox got back from the repair center so I took the elite back to walmart. Now my licenses wont transfer back. Ugh. Now I have to be signed into xbox live to use my downloaded content until March 2010. Not a huge deal, but still pretty annoying. Also, my sister gave me a playstation 3. Now I have all the current consoles…for the second time in my life…(last time was dreamcast, ps2, and n64).

I have a ridiculous amount of stuff to do this quarter so I probably wont have a lot to say on here. Ugh.
