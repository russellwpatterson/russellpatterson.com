From now on, I will be most likely wearing contacts. I’ve been trying them out for the past few weeks and so far I really enjoy having them. I’ve actually become pretty good at putting them in and taking them out, which was my main problem last time I tried them.

My Xbox came back from the repair center so I took the Elite back to Walmart. Now my licenses won't transfer back. Ugh. Now I have to be signed into Xbox Live to use my downloaded content until March 2010. Not a huge deal, but still pretty annoying. Also, my sister gave me a Playstation 3. Now I have all the current consoles…for the second time in my life…(last time was Dreamcast, PS2, and N64).

I have a ridiculous amount of stuff to do this quarter so I probably won't have a lot to say on here. Ugh.
