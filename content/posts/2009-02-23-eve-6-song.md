One of my friends told me about this song. It’s awesome. It’s Think Twice by Eve 6. Listen to it if you get a chance.

When all is said and done
And dead does he love you
The way that I do
Breathing in lightning
Tonight’s for fighting
I feel the hurt so physical

Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around I’ll let you feel the burn
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around come around no more
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around I’ll let you feel the burn
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around no more

She spreads her love
She burns me up
I can’t let go
I can’t get out
I’ve said enough
Enough by now
I can’t let go
I can’t get out

Wait till the day you finally see
I’ve been here waiting patiently
Crossing my fingers and my t’s
She cried on my shoulder begging please

Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around I’ll let you feel the burn
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around come around no more
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around I’ll let you feel the burn
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around no more

She spreads her love
She burns me up
I can’t let go
I can’t get out
I’ve said enough
Enough by now
I can’t let go
I can’t get out

What is it you really want
I’m tired of asking
You’re gone I’m wasted

When I showed up and he was there
I tried my best to grin and bear
And took the stairs but didn’t stop at the street
And as we speak I’m going down

Cause she spread her love
And burnt me up
I can’t let go
I can’t get out
I’ve said enough
Enough by now
I can’t let go
I can’t get out

Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around I’ll let you feel the burn
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around come around no more
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around I’ll let you feel the burn
Think twice before you touch my girl
Come around no more
