Just thought I'd say a little bit about the ongoing Alarm 4 work that I'm doing.

Although it was put on the back burner there for a while, I've recently started working on Alarm 4 once again. I'm about 90% finished on the event system and I've completed the revamped playlist system. There is still a lot of UI work to be done but I'm going to start attacking that here in the next few days. I've also ported the new media stuff that I wrote and updated the core to the latest (3.5.15) version.

I will hopefully be putting out an alpha before the end of the month, as long as I can continue working on it.
