Today, I'm releasing Alarm 3.5.9 Release Candidate 2.  This is only a minor update of the previous RC build, in fact, it only has the build tag 35932 instead of 35931, so it's clearly only a minor change.

This new release candidate version contains the option to focus the alarm time while the alarm is set.  This was suggested by someone on download.com and I decided to add it to 3.5.9 after I realized that it wouldn't be difficult at all.

Enjoy.  Final build probably coming Thursday.
