I have many, many things to do this week. Just though Iâ€™d get it written down.

*Get an eye exam and new glasses
*Clean up the room and car
*Sell some stuff on eBay
*Buy Halo Wars
*Get my two computers ready to be sold
*Release Alarm 3.5.5 and begin working on 3.6
*Get the interrupt stuff done for senior design.

So yeah, I will also be playing plenty of video games to pass my free time.
