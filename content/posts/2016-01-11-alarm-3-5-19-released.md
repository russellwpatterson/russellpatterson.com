Today, I officially released Alarm 3.5.19. You can get it on the "Things I Work On" page, or just Check for Updates in the application. This is the first official release of Alarm since July 2011, so there is a huge amount of changes (even though it is a minor revision).

This version contains several performance enhancements and large rewrites of core areas of the application. It also updates the Update Checker to the new RWC API. It is targeted against .NET 3.5 and also removes support for Windows XP.

Please Note: All previous versions will no longer be supported as of April 10, 2016, so it'll be a good idea for you to upgrade as soon as you can. After that date passes, the update check in the software will no longer function, and you will have to upgrade manually.
