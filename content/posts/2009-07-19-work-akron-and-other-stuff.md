So I’m working about 40 hours a week trying to get permissions done for one of SAY’s projects. In my spare time, I’m trying to play some halo and work on Alarm 4. My last day of work before I make the move to Akron is July 31 which means I only have 10 days left. Yes.

I’m moving to Akron on August 8th. I start my research on network protocols on August 10th. I visited Akron a week or so ago and I really enjoyed it so I think living in the area will be pretty awesome. Plus, I’ll be close to Tree(Fairview Park), Megan(Wooster), and Tim(Canfield) (for at least a little while).

Also, I’m addicted to Rescue Me now. It is so good. I’m also rewatching Arrested Development and also watching Dead Like Me.

I live such an exciting life.
