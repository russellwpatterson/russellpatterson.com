I just released Points Calculator v1.1 on the "Things I Work On" page. It uses a well-known points-based weight loss formula to calculate how many "points" a particular food is worth. I used to use it in college, and I haven't really messed with it since then, but I figured I would put it up here in case anyone can use it. It's also open source if you want to check out how it was made. No real magic there though, just a simple button event and an equation. Anyway, enjoy.
