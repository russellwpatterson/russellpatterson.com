Tonight, I will be installing Windows 7 Professional on my main computer. I’ve tried the release candidate and I really liked it so now is the time to get away from Vista. Although I like Vista, I know it’s all sluggish and such, and I haven’t reinstalled it since November 2008, so it’s time for the upgrade. I know it doesn’t come out until Oct 22, but I’m an early adopter. I also got Vista in November 2006 when it didn’t come out until January 2007.

I spent about 5 hours copying files to by external hard drive last night so I think I’m ready to go for it tonight. I might actually copy the files to another hard drive too, I haven’t decided yet. I just don’t want to lose all my stuff (about 350 GB).

One of my major tasks for the next few weeks is going to be making Alarm 3.5 compatible with Windows 7. I think it is currently 95% compatible but there is a chance that some stuff will break.

That’s all I can think to write right now.
