I found a minor bug with Alarm 3.5.9 so I'm going to be releasing an update soon.  I haven't decided if it's going to be 3.5.9.1 or 3.5.10 yet though.  It literally has only about 2-3 lines of code changed from 3.5.9 so I'm leaning towards the 3.5.9.1 tag.  I'm testing it heavily to stamp out any other bugs I can find so I don't have to keep maintaining this version.  If I find other bugs, I'll go with 3.5.10.

That's all for now.  Look for the next version of 3.5 soon.
