So while working on Alarm 4, I found an issue in the snooze/quick alarm functionality in v3.5.12-3.5.15. So, I will be releasing Alarm 3.5.16 on December 4. While I've already finished the bug fix, I am spending a great deal of time to test and make sure something like this doesn't happen again.

It is a pretty serious bug, but it doesn't affect too many users. Basically, I found out that if you have 24 hour clock mode enabled and you snooze or use quick alarm between 12:00 and 23:59, the alarm time will be incorrect. If this affects you, i.e. you use Alarm in the afternoon and you use 24 hour clock, please email me at russell (AT) russellpatterson.com and I will send you the fixed version immediately. Again, it doesn't affect anyone who is not using 24 hour clock mode.

Thanks.
