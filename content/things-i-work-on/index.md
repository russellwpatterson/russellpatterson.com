**Alarm**

Alarm is a PC-based alarm clock which includes many features common to actual alarm clocks. It was first developed when I was a freshman in college as a simple experiment in my new programming abilities. I've since added over 50 features and re-written it from the ground up to be super stable and reliable. It can play MP3/WMA/WAV files and it offers updates when they become available.
