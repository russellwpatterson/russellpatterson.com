**Simple Lookups**

Simple Lookups is a little .NET library that makes it incredibly easy to manage those "lookup" values, i.e. types of things. For example, if you have a database of "providers", you might also have a database table called "ProviderType" that has all the different types of providers that there are in your system. These tables often have the same structure (i.e., Name, Description, Code, Active) and can therefore be generically managed. Simple Lookups manages these types of tables with barely any code for you to write. All you need is a connection string, a blank derived class for each type that inherits from the Simple Lookups' Lookup type, and you're good to go.

**Alarm**

Alarm is a PC-based alarm clock which includes many features common to actual alarm clocks. It was first developed when I was a freshman in college as a simple experiment in my new programming abilities. I've since added over 50 features and re-written it from the ground up to be super stable and reliable. It can play MP3/WMA/WAV files and it offers updates when they become available.

**Points Calculator**

Points Calculator uses a well known weight loss formula to calculate how many "points" a certain food item is worth in a diet. It's open source. The formula is copyrighted by the company that created it. That's all I'm saying.

**Cryptography Tools**

Crypto Tools is a collection of tools that just take any file, and generate an MD5 or SHA256 checksum of that file. The tools are also open source and incredibly simple. They're clones of the tools in Linux, but they're written in C# and run on Windows. I suggest throwing them into your Windows directory or adding them to your PATH, but that's up to you.
