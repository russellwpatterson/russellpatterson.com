At one point, I know there were over 30k downloads of Alarm 3.5, and something like 1500 active daily users. I was blown away all those years ago by the impact my dumb little spare time project had on so many people. I still get emails occasionally of people who tell me how much they love it and how cool it would be if I&rsquo;d continue developing it, or if I&rsquo;d open source it.</p><p>Honestly, I&rsquo;ve spent the last 10 years wanting to work on Alarm 4, but I&rsquo;ve been unable to motivate myself for more than a couple of days. Sadly, I just don&rsquo;t think I was interested in the project any more.</p><p>One of the things that I do want to do is update it to run on .NET Core 3. I think this will likely be a minor revision, not a 4.x version. More than likely it&rsquo;ll be v3.9 or something like that.</p><p>If I do get the time and focus to re-platform it onto .NET Core, I will be willing to open source it. The shame in me won&rsquo;t let me release code that I started working on when I had -2 years of professional experience, but giving the codebase a once over with some re-architecting will make it &ldquo;community ready&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simple Lookups 3</strong></p><p>When I wrote Simple Lookups, it was something that I was planning to use at the company that I worked for at the time. I spent only about 8 months actually developing it, and as part of that, I got a chance to create a useful NuGet package, and even made an appearance on a podcast to talk about it.</p><p>Simple Lookups has been downloaded a couple thousand times, which is awesome, but more modern solutions like Entity Framework are far more popular and perform just as well. Because of this, I haven&rsquo;t made any changes to that codebase since 2016. I&rsquo;ve thought more than once that I should actually get it working on the .NET Core platform, but I&rsquo;ve never got around to it. But, over the next six months, I plan to create a new version of Simple Lookups that will run on the .NET Core platform. It will still be limited to SQL Server lookups, but I will make sure that the codebase is compatible with .NET Standard and runs well on both Core and Framework.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pattern of the Week</strong></p><p>I still want to do these, but I got burnt out. I&rsquo;m thinking about rebranding as &ldquo;Pattern in Focus&rdquo; or something like that, and shoot for trying to get one out every couple weeks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simple Settings</strong></p><p>I had started a project based on some of the work I had done on Alarm 4 - a really simple way to manage application settings. Basically, this library would handle all the storage of key-value pairs into either the Windows Registry, INI files, XML files, or JSON files.</p><p>I made it about 50% through the development of a 1.0 version, but then I shelved it. I&rsquo;m not sure that this will ever be released, and in fact, I&rsquo;m only mentioning it so that I don&rsquo;t forget about it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chron</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;ve worked a little bit on a simple git tagging tool that automatically increments and pushes a git tag to the remote. It&rsquo;s pretty heavily based on a solution we had at one of my clients, but I&rsquo;m writing it from the ground up in C#. I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;ll be a few months on this one before I&rsquo;m ready to release it.</p></li><li><p><strong>RussellWritesCode.com</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;ve spent a bit of time over the last couple weeks to bring over all of my previous content from my old blog into this format. I believe things came over, but there&rsquo;s always a chance it didn&rsquo;t. If you see something, say something.</p></li></ul><p>As far as general life updates, we now have three cats - Avery (8), Polly (8), and Daisy (1). I&rsquo;m going to have to do a better job of posting about them, or at the very least, start throwing some things on Instagram.</p></div><footer></footer></article><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script><script type=text/javascript async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/startup.js id=MathJax-script></script><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[['$','$'],['\\(','\\)']],processEscapes:!0,processEnvironments:!0},options:{skipHtmlTags:['script','noscript','style','textarea','pre']}}</script></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>Not a strong bowler.</p>© 2008 - 2021
