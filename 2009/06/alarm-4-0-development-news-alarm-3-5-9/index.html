This version includes many new enhancements, the most noticeable of which is the new scheduling system.</p><p>The system allows for the user to set multiple alarms with various means of notification. These include the classic system beep from Alarm 2.0-2.9, the single song functionality from Alarm 3.0/3.1, the playlist functionality from Alarm 3.5, and a new type of alert done by using the Windows system sounds. These scheduled events will be able to be set to go off on specific days of the week too.</p><p>Also coming in Alarm 4 is an overhaul of the theming system. As of right now, it is planned that the UI will be capable of being completely skinned. This means that there will probably be a theme site up for the software where these new and improved skins can be downloaded.</p><p>The final thing that I want to talk about is the way that users will be interacting with the alarm. I am not sure as of yet, but I think that this may be the first version of Alarm without a main window. This means that all of the configuration, etc. will be done by using the tray icon. I am just having trouble coming up with a compelling enough reason to continue having the main window when all the alarm setting, etc. will be available in other dialogs. I might also just make it an option or something.</p><p>Well, that&rsquo;s about it for Alarm 4. Look for it later this summer.</p><p>As for the next version of Alarm 3.5, I will be releasing version 3.5.9 within the next week or so. This version will contain a single new feature, volume management, which was originally intended for Alarm 4. It will also include an enhancement to the update service which will support updating to Alarm 4. This will also be the final version of Alarm 3.5 as development efforts will seriously be focused on Alarm 4.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p></div><footer></footer></article><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script><script type=text/javascript async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/startup.js id=MathJax-script></script><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[['$','$'],['\\(','\\)']],processEscapes:!0,processEnvironments:!0},options:{skipHtmlTags:['script','noscript','style','textarea','pre']}}</script></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>Not a strong bowler.</p>© 2008 - 2021
