The zoomed iPhone 5s display looks really terrible, folks! So, I&amp;rsquo;m going to give you a five minute tutorial to update your applications. Assuming, of course, that you updated your app last year for iOS 7. I&amp;rsquo;m also assuming that you have a reasonable understanding of how to navigate Xcode, so this post is a bit light on screenshots.</description></item><item><title>iOS 8: Notifications Changes</title><link>/2014/09/ios-8-notifications-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2014 04:04:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2014/09/ios-8-notifications-changes/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re updating our iOS application at work, and I came across some fun with iOS 8 and notifications. So, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a short post about it.
In iOS 7, we used the following method on the shared UIApplication instance to set up notifications:
[[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:( UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert | UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound )]; In iOS 8, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. So now, it&amp;rsquo;s a multi-step process:
UIApplication *application = [UIApplication sharedApplication]; UIUserNotificationSettings *settings = [UIUserNotificationSettings settingsForTypes:(UIUserNotificationTypeAlert | UIUserNotificationTypeBadge | UIUserNotificationTypeSound) categories:nil]; [application registerUserNotificationSettings:settings]; [application registerForRemoteNotifications]; First, we get an instance of the shared UIApplication (this is obviously optional, but I think it makes the code easier to read).</description></item></channel></rss>
