In my spare time, I’m trying to play some Halo and work on Alarm 4. My last day of work before I make the move to Akron is July 31 which means I only have 10 days left. Yes.
I’m moving to Akron on August 8th. I start my research on network protocols on August 10th.</description></item><item><title>Contacts, Video Games, Etc.</title><link>/2009/03/contacts-video-games-etc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2009 04:00:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2009/03/contacts-video-games-etc/</guid><description>From now on, I will be most likely wearing contacts. I’ve been trying them out for the past few weeks and so far I really enjoy having them. I’ve actually become pretty good at putting them in and taking them out, which was my main problem last time I tried them.
My Xbox came back from the repair center so I took the Elite back to Walmart. Now my licenses won&amp;rsquo;t transfer back.</description></item><item><title>Why me?</title><link>/2009/02/why-me/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2009 04:00:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2009/02/why-me/</guid><description>Well, obviously since I was going to be playing a bunch of games this week, my xbox just HAD to die. It gave me the red lights, so I went out and bought a new one. I mean, I just got addicted to Assassins Creed and I had just preordered Halo Wars. What timing! I still haven’t transferred everything over yet, but I should be able to do that today. I bought the Elite so I really hope this one lasts.</description></item><item><title>To Do List</title><link>/2009/02/to-do-list/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2009 05:00:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2009/02/to-do-list/</guid><description>I have many, many things to do this week. Just though I’d get it written down.
Get an eye exam and new glasses Clean up the room and car Sell some stuff on eBay Buy Halo Wars Get my two computers ready to be sold Release Alarm 3.5.5 and begin working on 3.6 Get the interrupt stuff done for senior design. So yeah, I will also be playing plenty of video games to pass my free time.</description></item></channel></rss>
