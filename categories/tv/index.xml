In my spare time, I’m trying to play some Halo and work on Alarm 4. My last day of work before I make the move to Akron is July 31 which means I only have 10 days left. Yes.
I’m moving to Akron on August 8th. I start my research on network protocols on August 10th.</description></item></channel></rss>
