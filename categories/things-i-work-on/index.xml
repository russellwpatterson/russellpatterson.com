You can get it on the &amp;ldquo;Things I Work On&amp;rdquo; page, or just Check for Updates in the application. This is the first official release of Alarm since July 2011, so there is a huge amount of changes (even though it is a minor revision).
This version contains several performance enhancements and large rewrites of core areas of the application. It also updates the Update Checker to the new RWC API.</description></item></channel></rss>
