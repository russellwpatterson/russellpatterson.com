Simple Lookups is a little .NET library that makes it incredibly easy to manage those &ldquo;lookup&rdquo; values, i.e. types of things. For example, if you have a database of &ldquo;providers&rdquo;, you might also have a database table called &ldquo;ProviderType&rdquo; that has all the different types of providers that there are in your system. These tables often have the same structure (i.e., Name, Description, Code, Active) and can therefore be generically managed."><meta property="og:title" content="Things I Work On"><meta property="og:description" content="Simple Lookups

For example, if you have a database of &ldquo;providers&rdquo;, you might also have a database table called &ldquo;ProviderType&rdquo; that has all the different types of providers that there are in your system. These tables often have the same structure (i.e., Name, Description, Code, Active) and can therefore be generically managed. Simple Lookups manages these types of tables with barely any code for you to write. All you need is a connection string, a blank derived class for each type that inherits from the Simple Lookups' Lookup type, and you&rsquo;re good to go.</p><p><a href=https://www.simplelookups.com>Visit Website</a></p><p><strong>Alarm</strong></p><p>Alarm is a PC-based alarm clock which includes many features common to actual alarm clocks. It was first developed when I was a freshman in college as a simple experiment in my new programming abilities. I&rsquo;ve since added over 50 features and re-written it from the ground up to be super stable and reliable. It can play MP3/WMA/WAV files and it offers updates when they become available.</p><p>Download Alarm: <a href=/apps/alarm/alarm-latest.exe>Latest | 3.5.19 (January 10, 2016)</a></p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>Not a strong bowler.</p>© 2008 - 2021
